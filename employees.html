    <h4>CFO (Chief Fairy Operator)</h4>
    <h5>November 1667</h5>
    <p>Chandler began Fairyies "R" Us in November of 1667 in order to, "make the world a better place."

Unfortunately he does not have any down time because he is busy running a company 24/7. However, during his scheduled 5 minute break every week, he likes to chew gum.</p>
